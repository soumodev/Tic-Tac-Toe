# Tic-Tac-Toe

A Neural Network that takes as input a configuration of a sudoku grid and the next move of a player and returns if it is a "Good" move or a "Bad" move.
Then use this Network to verify if certain properties holds. That is, given a property P for the input of the NN if the NN correctly predicts if for such
inputs the output is "Good" or "Bad" using the Z3-solver. 

## Description

The source code is a Python notebook.

The first section generates the dataset that is used to train the Neural Network.

The second section creates the Neural Network(I used Keras to build the Network :P)

The next sections verifies the properties that are given as Question 3,4 in the assignment pdf.

## Running the code

To run the code just execute all the modules one by one
